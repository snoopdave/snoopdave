### Hi 👋

I’m a software engineer focused on APIs, platforms, and distributed systems.

I created Apache Roller in 2002, brought it to the Apache Software Foundation, and led it through the Incubator to top-level project status in 2007. I’ve been involved in open source for a long time, including work at Sun Microsystems, Apigee, CloudBees, and Apollo GraphQL.

This profile is mostly long-running projects, experiments, and practical code.
